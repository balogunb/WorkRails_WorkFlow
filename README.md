# WorkRails_WorkFlow
A workflow created using React. Interact with salesforce's back end via jsforce.


Open the front end folder to access the react app and the backend folder to access the express app

The react app is dependent on the backend to connect with SalesForce, so both the backend app and the frontend react app need to be running for the project
